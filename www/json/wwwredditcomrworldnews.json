Brandon Overstreet, a doctoral candidate in hydrology at the University of Wyoming, picked his way across the frozen landscape, clipped his climbing harness to an anchor in the ice and crept toward the edge of a river that rushed downstream toward an enormous sinkhole.</p>\n<p>If he fell in, \"the death rate is 100 percent,\" said Mr. Overstreet's friend and fellow researcher, Lincoln Pitcher.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Overstreet's task, to collect critical data from the river, is essential to understanding one of the most consequential impacts of global warming. The scientific data he and a team of six other researchers collect here could yield groundbreaking information on the rate at which the melting of Greenland ice sheet, one of the biggest and fastest-melting chunks of ice on Earth, will drive up sea levels in the coming decades. The full melting of Greenland's ice sheet could increase sea levels by about 20 feet.</p>\n<p>\"We scientists love to sit at our computers and use climate models to make those predictions,\" said Laurence C. Smith, head of the geography department at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the leader of the team that worked in Greenland this summer. \"But to really know what's happening, that kind of understanding can only come about through empirical measurements in the field.\"</p>\n<p>For years, scientists have studied the impact of the planet's warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. But while researchers have satellite images to track the icebergs that break off, and have created models to simulate the thawing, they have little on-the-ground information and so have trouble predicting precisely how fast sea levels will rise.</p>\n<p>Scientists know that <b>the melting of Greenland is accelerating</b>. As the temperature rises, large lakes form on the surface of the ice, which in turn create a network of rivers.</p>\n<p>\" <b>The rivers melt down faster than the surrounding ice</b>, like a knife through butter,\" Dr. Smith said.</p>\n<p>The rivers then flow down into giant holes in the ice, called <b>moulins</b>, which drain through tunnels in the ice sheet and out into the ocean.</p>\n<p>\" <b>The ice sheet is porous</b>, like Swiss cheese,\" Dr. Smith said. \"We didn't know that until this year.\"</p>\n<p>This summer in Greenland, the <b>scientists set up their camp on the ice</b>, where they hoped to capture the first comprehensive measurements of the rate of melting.</p>\n<p>Their research could yield valuable information to help scientists figure out how rapidly sea levels will rise in the 21st century, and thus how people in coastal areas from New York to Bangladesh could plan for the change.</p>\n<p>Each year, the federal government spends about $1 billion to support Arctic and Antarctic research by thousands of scientists like Dr. Smith and his team. The agency officials who receive that money from Congress, including the directors of the National Science Foundation, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, say the research is essential for understanding the changes that will affect the world's population and economies for more than a century.</p>\n<p>But the research is under increasing fire by some Republican leaders in Congress, who deny or question the scientific consensus that human activities contribute to climate change.</p>\n<p>Leading the Republican charge on Capitol Hill is Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House science committee, who has sought to cut $300 million from NASA's budget for earth science and has started an inquiry into some 50 National Science Foundation grants. On Oct. 13, the committee subpoenaed scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking more than six years of internal deliberations, including \"all documents and communications\" related to the agency's measurement of climate change.</p>\n<p>Any cuts could directly affect the work of Dr. Smith and his team, who are supported by a three-year, $778,000 grant from NASA, which must cover everything, including researchers' salaries, flights, food, computers, scientific instruments and camping, safety and extreme cold-weather gear. Every scientist, Dr. Smith said, is keenly aware that the research costs \"a tremendous amount of taxpayer money.\"</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>Getting Ready </p>\n<p>In July, Dr. Smith's team arrived in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, a dusty outpost of 512 people on the island's southwest coast, which serves as a base for researchers to prepare for fieldwork on the ice sheet.</p>\n<p>The scientists were excited but anxious as they prepared to travel inland by helicopter to do the fieldwork at the heart of their research: For 72 hours, every hour on the hour, they would stand watch by a supraglacial watershed, taking measurements - velocity, volume, temperature and depth - from the icy bank of the rushing river.</p>\n<p>\"No one has ever collected a data set like this,\" Asa Rennermalm, a professor of geography at the Rutgers University Climate Institute who was running the project with Dr. Smith, told the team over a lunch of musk ox burgers at the Kangerlussuaq airport cafeteria.</p>\n<p>Taking each measurement was so difficult and dangerous that it would require two scientists at a time, she said. They would have to plan a sleep schedule to ensure that a group was always awake to do the job. Everyone knew the team would be working just upriver from the moulin - the sinkhole that would sweep anyone who fell into it deep into the ice sheet.</p>\n<p>The morning before their departure, the team gathered in a hangar to pack gear and provisions: tents, collapsible metal cots, generators, pickaxes, crampons, freeze-dried meals, a wealth of scientific instruments, vials for snow, ice and water samples, and a cooler to bring those samples back to labs in the United States.</p>\n<p>They also took toilet paper and several plastic bottles, each labeled in marker with a large letter \"P.\" The bottles were for the scientists to urinate in should they not want to go outside in below-freezing nighttime temperatures to the open-air \"toilet\" on the ice. Afterward they would serve a practical purpose, as hot water bottles tucked into sleeping bags.</p>\n<p>Not least, they packed a pair of 10-pound aerial drones, to map the icy watersheds.</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>Every item was weighed and reweighed since the helicopter could carry no more than 360 kilograms - 794 pounds - and would have to make several trips. Dr. Smith's NASA grant covered 10 hours of helicopter flight time, including the pilot's fee, at a cost of about $5,000 per hour.</p>\n<p>The scale brought bad news: The gear was far too heavy. \"Now we start getting rid of things,\" Dr. Smith said grimly as he and the team began jettisoning extra food, utensils and blankets. They scaled down to the barest essentials and anxiously reweighed the items: 359.9 kilograms.</p>\n<p>At last the helicopter took off with the team's gear hanging from an attached net sling. The scientists gazed at the seemingly endless surface of the ice, beneath the chopper, spreading in all directions, threaded with aquamarine rivers and lakes. After a 40-minute flight, the pilot cautiously bounced the helicopter on the ice, making sure it was hard enough to land on.</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>Stepping out, the scientists were hit by the cold of the Greenland summer - the temperature ranged from 27 degrees below zero to a balmy 40 while they were there - a constant wind and the glare of the sun.</p>\n<p>As the researchers began to set up camp, Mr. Overstreet, the University of Wyoming doctoral student, headed toward the river, silent as it sliced through the ice. More than any other member of the team, the success of the mission rested on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>Mr. Overstreet, 31, who grew up kayaking and rafting in Oregon, had designed the complex rope-and-pulley system - modeled on swift-water boat rescue systems - that would be crucial to gleaning data from the treacherous waters. Before coming to Greenland, he spent months refining and practicing his rope system on rivers in Wyoming.</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>The team soon got to work. A helicopter pilot flew two of Mr. Overstreet's colleagues, Mr. Pitcher and Matthew Cooper, across the 60-foot river. On the opposite bank they drilled into the ice, attached an anchor and harnessed themselves to it for safety. They attached a nylon line to the anchor, with the rest of the line coiled in a heavy bag.</p>\n<p>Now came the crucial part: The men took turns hurling the bag across the river, but it repeatedly fell into the water. After an anxious half-hour, Mr. Cooper finally got the rope across. Mr. Overstreet caught it and began setting up the rope-and-pulley system he had been testing for so long.</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>Farther upstream, Dr. Smith cast what looked like three small, round life preservers into the river. At $3,000 each, they were equipped with waterproof computers, GPS and sonar depth technology, all to beam back information about the river's elevation, speed, depth and more. But the drifters were on kamikaze missions. After sending back the measurements, they would be swept into the moulin.</p>\n<p>\"That's 3,000 taxpayer dollars, going down the hole,\" Dr. Smith said.</p>\n<p>On the edge of the camp, Johnny Ryan, a doctoral candidate in geography at Aberystwyth University in Wales, launched an airplane-shaped drone from a slingshot-like device, then guided it over a nearly 75-square-mile area. But then the drone went silent. \"It stopped talking to me, and now it's crashed in the wilderness,\" Mr. Ryan said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ryan, who wore a hot-pink knit cap and purple sunglasses that set off his bright red beard, launched his backup drone. Feeling stressed, he monitored its flight nervously as the hours rolled by, drinking cups of tea to keep warm.</p>\n<p>At the riverbank, Mr. Overstreet and Mr. Pitcher started the data collection by clipping a computer device that looked like a boogie board to the line running across the river. Every hour they sent it back and forth to measure the water's depth, velocity and temperature.</p>\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png\"><p>But as the day stretched into night, the device's battery, sapped by the cold, began to die. By now the sun had dropped lower, filling the sky with a spectacular orange glow. The scientists were worried - the death of the battery would mean the death of their mission.</p>\n<p>An idea occurred to Mr. Overstreet. He found a roll of heat-reflecting silver sheeting at the camp and wrapped it around the boogie board battery. During the next run across the river, it stayed alive.</p>\n<p>But the battery continued to wane, so Mr. Pitcher pulled out gel hand warmers from his gloves and tucked them into the battery's silver jacket. Success. The battery stayed warm and functional.</p>\n<p>For the rest of their time on the ice, the scientists would have to ration the hand warmers. Saving the life of the battery would save the mission to record the first comprehensive on-the-ground, empirical data on the flow of a river off the ice sheet.</p>\n<p>The scientists will use the data, which they expect to publish in the coming months, to test whether climate models are accurate.</p>\n<p>The data can then be used to create a new model to estimate the amount of water flowing from <b>thousands of similar rivers</b>.</p>\n<p>The data gathered from the river at the <b>top of the sheet</b> will be compared with measurements the scientists have taken at its foot.</p>\n<p>With both sets of data, the scientists can help create the most accurate projections to date of the rate of sea level rise.</p>\n<p>They might even learn, Dr. Smith said, that the water is refreezing within the ice sheet and that sea levels are actually rising more slowly than models project.</p>\n<p>For three days and three nights, the scientists continued to measure the river, as up to 430,000 gallons of water a minute poured off the ice and into the moulin. On the final morning, the team, tired but elated, gathered by the river as the boogie board made its final trip. By then, Mr. Ryan's backup drone had safely completed its mapping mission. Mr. Overstreet broke open a celebratory bag of dried mangoes - a lavish treat for the ice campers.</p>\n<p>\"It's hard to make the choice to come on projects like this, but everything in my life has prepared me to come out here,\" Mr. Overstreet said. \"We go from battling the river to working with it, and then we learn so much from it.\"</p>\n</div>"},{"description":"China's Foreign Ministry

\"illegally entered into the waters of China's Spratly Islands.\"</p>\n<p>\"The action taken by the U.S. warship has threatened China's sovereignty and security interest, and has put the safety of personnel on the reefs in danger,\" the ministry said. </p>\n<p>The operation put the ship within an area that would be considered Chinese sovereign territory if the U.S. recognized the man-made islands as being Chinese territory, the official added. </p>\n<p>The United States hadn't breached the 12-mile limit since China began massive dredging operations to turn three reefs into artificial islands in 2014 -- even though maritime law doesn't usually accord territorial waters to islands built on previously submerged reefs. </p>\n<h3>Rival claims</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/china-south-china-sea-airstrip/index.html\">South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival</a> and often messy territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters.</p>\n<p>In little more than 18 months, China has reclaimed more than 2,000 acres at three main locations in the Spratly Islands -- Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs, where it's building <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/china-south-china-sea-airstrip/\">airstrips thought to be capable of handling bombers</a>.</p>\n<p>China's Foreign Ministry reiterated that its activity in the South China Sea didn't affect freedom of navigation by sea or air but said it held \"indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and its nearby waters.\" </p>\n<p>\"China is resolutely opposed to any country damaging China's sovereignty and security interest in the name of freedom of navigation and overflight,\" it said. </p>\n<p>In May, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/\">a U.S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew swooped over the Spratly Islands</a>, triggering eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off.</p>\n<p>Chinese navy ships entered U.S. territorial waters off Alaska in September, coming within 12 miles of the coastline during<a href=\"http://cnn.com/2015/08/31/politics/obama-climate-speech-alaska/\"> President Barack Obama's visit</a> to the state, U.S. officials told CNN at the time.</p>\n<p>The officials emphasized that China's actions were consistent with \"innocent passage\" under international maritime law. </p>\n<h3>'Routine operation'</h3>\n<p>Another defense official told CNN that the operation was \"routine\" and was in accordance with international law.</p>\n<p>\"We will fly, sail and operate anywhere in the world that international law allows,\" the official said. </p>\n<p>\"U.S. Freedom of Navigation operations are global in scope and executed against a wide range of excessive maritime claims, irrespective of the coastal state advancing the excessive claim,\" the official added. </p>\n<p>His comments echoed those of State Department spokesman John Kirby on Monday, who said one country didn't need to consult another \"when you are exercising the right of freedom of navigation in international waters.\" </p>\n<p>The rest of the region, wary of China's intentions in the disputed waters, is likely to welcome the U.S. move. </p>\n<p>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declined to comment on the operation but said \"it was extremely important that the international community work together in order to protect open, free and peaceful ocean.\"</p>\n<p>Australia said it \"strongly supports\" the rights of all countries to travel through the South China Sea.</p>\n<p>Taiwan said it rejected China's claim of sovereignty over the Spratly archipelago and called for dialogue to resolve the dispute peacefully. </p>\n<h3>Challenge? </h3>\n<p>Greg Poling, director of the <a href=\"http://amti.csis.org/\">Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative </a>at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the U.S. operation was aimed at testing control of the seas, not sovereignty over the disputed islands, and would present a dilemma for China. </p>\n<p>\"It forces a clarification of China's claims. China's strategy in the South China Sea is one of ambiguity,\" he said. </p>\n<p>Poling said under maritime law, artificial islands were not usually afforded the 12-mile territorial zone, and that the U.S. Navy deliberately chose to send the destroyer near Subi Reef for this reason. </p>\n<p>Before China's recent land reclamation, both Subi and Mischief reefs were submerged at high tide, while a sandbar was visible at high-tide at Fiery Cross Reef, which could make its legal status more ambiguous. </p>\n<p>\"So if Beijing objects by saying to the U.S. you're in our territorial sea, then the U.S. can respond by saying there's no such thing as a territorial sea for an artificial island,\" Poling said. </p>\n<p>He said that the decision to go ahead with the mission follows months of discussion in Washington and likely followed Chinese President Xi Jinping's trip to Washington last month, which made little headway on the South China Sea. </p>\n<p>CNN's Barbara Starr and Yuli Yang contributed to this report.</p>\n</div>"},{"description":"It only takes a glance at a history book and a look out the window to know that our planet has lost many of its biggest creatures: The world

But according to a new study, we've got more to mourn than just the animals themselves. We've lost their feces, too - and that's a bigger problem than you might think.</p> \n<p>Why should we miss steaming piles of dinosaur dung? According to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1502549112\">research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, megafauna play a greater role in the spread of nutrients across the planet than scientists ever realized.</p> \n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/10/02/farmer-digs-up-woolly-mammoth-bones-in-michigan-soy-field/\"><em>Farmer digs up woolly mammoth bones in Michigan soy field</em></a>]</p> \n<p>The research focused on modeling the distribution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus\">phosphorus</a>, a nutrient necessary for fertilizing plant growth. Scientists know that animals help carry these nutrients around by, well, not pooping where they eat. Without this process, nutrients would end up following gravity onto the ocean floor, instead of spreading as high as the mountain tops. But these days most of the nutrient recycling that happens is due to bacteria - not wandering poopers. </p> \n<p>\"I wanted to know whether the world of the past with all the endemic animals was more fertile than our current world,\" lead study author <a href=\"http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/doughtychris.php\">Chris Doughty</a> of Oxford University told The Post.</p> \n<p>[<em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/09/22/a-lost-world-of-dinosaurs-thrived-in-the-snowy-dark-of-alaska-researchers-say/\">A 'lost world' of dinosaurs thrived in the snowy dark of Alaska, researchers say</a></em>]</p> \n<p>\"Large free-ranging animals are much less abundant than they once were. Today, if scientists were to study the role of animals they would find that it is important but small,\" Doughty explained. \"However, in the past, we hypothesize that it would have been at least an order of magnitude larger than today. Essentially, we have replaced wild free-roaming animals with fenced domestic cattle that cannot move nutrients in the same way.\"</p> \n<img src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2015/10/101907.jpg&amp;w=480\"><br><p>Some of these contributors - the massive land animals that once roamed our planet - are gone for good. But others are dwindling before our very eyes. In one example of the effect, the researchers found that whales - which have seen dramatic population loss in the last century, mainly due to hunting and habitat disruption - used to bring an estimated 750 million pounds of phosphorus up from the deep ocean to the surface each year. Since whales feed deep in the water and come up to breathe - and poop - at the surface, they're great at helping to recycle these resources.</p> \n<p>[<em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/20/deaths-of-30-large-whales-in-alaska-declared-unusual-mortality-event/\">Since May, 30 whales have died off the Alaskan coast. Scientists are racing to find out why.</a></em>]</p> \n<p>But today, the researchers estimate, whales only bring 165 million pounds of phosphorus up annually. That's just 23 percent of their previous contribution. Phosphorus movement by birds and fish that come inland after eating in the sea (like salmon, for example) are just 4 percent what they once were.</p> \n<p>There's some good news: Some efforts to restore whale populations have been wildly successful. \"It was a relatively simple process,\" study co-author <a href=\"https://www.uvm.edu/giee/?Page=roman.html\">Joe Roman</a> of the University of Vermont told The Post. \"Stop killing them, halt commercial whaling, and they will return.\" But some whale populations are still struggling - there are still just a few thousand blue whales out in the wild, for example.</p> \n<p>The study authors warn that easily accessible phosphorus could disappear in as little as 50 years. Continuing to push for the recovery of these whales - and other large animals - could make a big difference.</p> \n<p>\"A world bereft of large wild animals, whether they are whales, salmon, albatrosses, or elephants, is a less productive place - and one that has lost much of its magic,\" Roman said. \"We can turn these effects around by restoring native populations of large vertebrates around the globe.\"</p> \n<strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/10/05/this-brilliant-plant-pretends-to-be-poop/\">This brilliant plant pretends to be poop</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/09/22/a-lost-world-of-dinosaurs-thrived-in-the-snowy-dark-of-alaska-researchers-say/\">A 'lost world' of dinosaurs thrived in the snowy dark of Alaska, researchers say</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/10/01/scientists-suggest-a-new-earth-shaking-twist-on-the-demise-of-the-dinosaurs/\">Scientists suggest a new, earth-shaking twist on the demise of the dinosaurs</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/31/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-the-perfect-poop-donor/\">Here's what it takes to be the perfect poop donor</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/10/06/why-is-the-halloween-whopper-turning-poop-green-a-washington-post-investigation/\">Why is the Halloween Whopper turning poop green?

This knowledge did not prevent the company (now ExxonMobil and the world's largest oil and gas company) from spending decades refusing to publicly acknowledge climate change and even promoting climate misinformation-an approach many have likened to the lies spread by the tobacco industry regarding the health risks of smoking. Both industries were conscious that their products wouldn't stay profitable once the world understood the risks, so much so that they used the same consultants to develop strategies on how to communicate with the public.  </p>\n<p>Experts, however, aren't terribly surprised. \"It's never been remotely plausible that they did not understand the science,\" says Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University. But as it turns out, Exxon didn't just understand the science, the company actively engaged with it. In the 1970s and 1980s it employed top scientists to look into the issue and launched its own ambitious research program that empirically sampled carbon dioxide and built rigorous climate models. Exxon even spent more than $1 million on a tanker project that would tackle how much CO2 is absorbed by the oceans. It was one of the biggest scientific questions of the time, meaning that Exxon was truly conducting unprecedented research. </p>\n<p>In their eight-month-long investigation, reporters at InsideClimate News interviewed former Exxon employees, scientists and federal officials and analyzed hundreds of pages of internal documents. They found that the company's knowledge of climate change dates back to July 1977, when its senior scientist James Black delivered a sobering message on the topic. \"In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,\" Black told Exxon's management committee. A year later he warned Exxon that doubling CO2 gases in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by two or three degrees-a number that is consistent with the scientific consensus today. He continued to warn that \"present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.\" In other words, Exxon needed to act.</p>\n<p>But ExxonMobil disagrees that any of its early statements were so stark, let alone conclusive at all. \"We didn't reach those conclusions, nor did we try to bury itlike they suggest,\" ExxonMobil spokesperson Allan Jeffers tells <em>Scientific American</em>. \"The thing that shocks me the most is that we've been saying this for years, that we have been involved in climate research. These guys go down and pull some documents that we made available publicly in the archives and portray them as some kind of bombshell whistle-blower expos&#233; because of the loaded language and the selective use of materials.\"<br><br> One thing is certain: in June 1988, when NASA scientist James Hansen told a congressional hearing that the planet was already warming, Exxon remained publicly convinced that the science was still controversial. Furthermore, experts agree that Exxon became a leader in campaigns of confusion. By 1989 the company had helped create the <a href=\"http://www.exxonsecrets.org/html/orgfactsheet.php?id=38\">Global Climate Coalition</a> (disbanded in 2002) to question the scientific basis for concern about climate change. It also helped to prevent the U.S. from signing the international treaty on climate known as the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 to control greenhouse gases. Exxon's tactic not only worked on the U.S. but also stopped other countries, such as China and India, from signing the treaty. At that point, \"a lot of things unraveled,\" Oreskes says.</p>\n<p>But experts are still piecing together Exxon's misconception puzzle. Last summer the Union of Concerned Scientists released a complementary investigation to the one by InsideClimate News, known as the <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/07/The-Climate-Deception-Dossiers.pdf\">Climate Deception Dossiers</a> (pdf). \"We included a memo of a coalition of fossil-fuel companies where they pledge basically to launch a big communications effort to sow doubt,\" says union president Kenneth Kimmel. \"There's even a quote in it that says something like 'Victory will be achieved when the average person is uncertain about climate science.' So it's pretty stark.\"</p>\n<p>Since then, Exxon has spent more than $30 million on think tanks that promote climate denial, <a href=\"http://www.exxonsecrets.org/maps.php\">according to Greenpeace</a>. Although experts will never be able to quantify the damage Exxon's misinformation has caused, \"one thing for certain is we've lost a lot of ground,\" Kimmell says. Half of the greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere were released after 1988. \"I have to think if the fossil-fuel companies had been upfront about this and had been part of the solution instead of the problem, we would have made a lot of progress [today] instead of doubling our greenhouse gas emissions.\"</p>\n<p>Experts agree that the damage is huge, which is why they are likening Exxon's deception to the lies spread by the tobacco industry. \"I think there are a lot of parallels,\" Kimmell says. Both sowed doubt about the science for their own means, and both worked with the same consultants to help develop a communications strategy. He notes, however, that the two diverge in the type of harm done. Tobacco companies threatened human health, but the oil companies threatened the planet's health. \"It's a harm that is global in its reach,\" Kimmel says.</p>\n<p>To prove this, Bob Ward-who on behalf of the U.K.'s Royal Academy sent a letter to Exxon in 2006 claiming its science was \"inaccurate and misleading\"-thinks a thorough investigation is necessary. \"Because frankly the episode with tobacco was probably the most disgraceful episode one could ever imagine,\" Ward says. Kimmell agrees. These reasons \"really highlight the responsibility that these companies have to come clean, acknowledge this, and work with everyone else to cut out emissions and pay for some of the cost we're going to bear as soon as possible,\" Kimmell says.</p>\n<p>It doesn't appear, however, that Kimmell will get his retribution. Jeffers claims the investigation's finds are \"just patently untrue, misleading, and we reject them completely\"-words that match Ward's claims against them nearly a decade ago.</p>\n</section></div>"},{"description":"Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has confirmed that the Turkish military has attacked Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.

Jimmy Morales, a television comedian with no political experience and no real policy platform, won with 70 percent.

The election was in large part a backlash to Guatemala's deeply entrenched corruption and crime problem, issues brought to the fore after President Otto P&#233;rez Molina was indicted on corruption charges in early September. Morales represented, as one Guatemalan citizen put it, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/americas/former-tv-comedian-jimmy-morales-seems-set-to-be-elected-guatemalas-president.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur\">\"the least worst option\"</a> in a country whose political class is terminally corrupted.</p>\n<p>The big question now is whether Guatemala's Stephen Colbert, as he's <a href=\"http://latinamericagoesglobal.org/2015/09/the-jon-stewart-of-guatemala/\">been called</a>, actually has what it takes to be president.</p>\n<h3>Why Guatemala elected a comedian</h3>\n<p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaZ5iqVijj9ryxniR0o2JdbQvLA=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4199451/GettyImages-485399374.jpg\"><cite>(Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images)</cite><figcaption>An anti-corruption protest in Guatemala in August. As you can see, it's not small.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Guatemala is one of Latin America's poorer countries. It's also a haven for drug traffickers and has the world's <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc\">fifth-highest homicide rate</a> (per UN data). But it's very, very hard for the country to make progress on these issues when its leaders <a href=\"http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1899\">routinely collude with cartels</a> and steal from public funds.</p>\n<p>\"A series of corrupt presidents have left the Guatemalan institutions - and particularly its judiciary - broken, corrupted and dependent on the executive,\" <a href=\"http://latinamericagoesglobal.org/2015/10/interview-chris-sabatini-talks-to-mandfredo-marroquin-of-guatemala/\">Manfredo Marroqu&#237;n</a>, the head of Transparency International Guatemala, told scholar Christopher Sabatini for the site <a href=\"http://latinamericagoesglobal.org/2015/10/interview-chris-sabatini-talks-to-mandfredo-marroquin-of-guatemala/\">Latin America Goes Global</a>. Marroqu&#237;n calls addressing this corruption \"the greatest challenge in Guatemala today.\"</p>\n<p>It's so bad, in fact, that the UN stepped in to help deal with it. In 2007, it established the <a href=\"http://www.cicig.org/index.php?page=home\">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a>, an investigative organization aimed at prosecuting corrupt Guatemalan officials. Against all odds, the Commission has had some real success. In April, it uncovered a customs bribery scam called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/world/americas/guatemalas-corruption-investigations-make-swift-strides.html\">La L&#237;nea</a>, which involved agents taking bribes at the border and sending kickbacks to the very top of the government. The revelations mobilized a massive protest movement against corruption, with weekly protests demanding that President Molina resign.</p>\n<p>Popular anger over corruption fueled Morales's once-quixotic candidacy. Perhaps his chief opponent was Sandra Torres de Colom, a former first lady and hence an inherently establishmentarian figure. That made it very difficult for Torres de Colom to capitalize on the anti-corruption sentiment. The total outsider, Morales, was the candidate least likely to be tainted by scandal.</p>\n<p>Before the campaign, Morales was well-known as a television comedian. In his most famous political sketch, he played a Guatemalan cowboy who - irony alert - becomes the country's president.</p>\n<p>Morales parlayed his high name recognition to become a public face of the anti-corruption protests, using social media and other platforms favored by the demonstrators to ally himself with the cause.</p>\n<p>In late August, just days before the election's first round of voting on September 6, Guatemalan officials arrested the country's vice president as part of its La L&#237;nea investigation - and publicly named President Molina the head of the scam. An arrest warrant for Molina was issued on September 2, and he was forced to resign.</p>\n<p>After Molina's resignation, the change wave became unstoppable. Morales won the first round of voting on September 6, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/world/americas/guatemala-presidential-election-jimmy-morales.html\">not by an outright majority</a>, requiring a runoff against the second-place Torres de Colom. That vote took place this Sunday, and Morales beat the former first lady in a landslide.</p>\n<p>After his inauguration in January, Jimmy Morales will officially have gone from comedian to president.</p>\n<h3>Morales's challenge as Guatemala's president</h3>\n<p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meM07IL5IbDFE2vcRciX7XFhcNs=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4199463/GettyImages-494297484.jpg\"><cite>(Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images)</cite><figcaption>Jimmy Morales during his victory speech.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Morales's campaign promise was very simple: Root out corruption. But no one has a clear sense for how he's going to do that - or, really, what else he'll end up getting done.</p>\n<p>\"Morales has not articulated a program of government, and many of his backers are unknown,\" Donald Planty, the former US ambassador to Latin America, explains in <a href=\"http://www.thedialogue.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LAA151026.pdf'\">Latin America Advisor</a>. \"His platform is essentially devoid of issues,\" <a href=\"http://www.thedialogue.org/experts/ben-raderstorf/\">Ben Raderstorf</a> and Haley Florsheim write at <a href=\"http://www.thedialogue.org/blogs/2015/10/guatemala-election-brief-not-corrupt-not-a-thief/\">the Dialogue</a>'s blog.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34632485\">BBC</a>, Morales is an evangelical Christian who opposes same-sex marriage, abortion, and legalized drugs. The BBC also notes some wackier policy ideas, including \"the tagging of teachers with a GPS device to ensure they attend classes and giving each Guatemalan child a smartphone.\"</p>\n<p>Morales's TV show focused on running characters, often ones portrayed as being stupid. The content of the show has been criticized for its portrayals of <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/26/jimmy_morales_wins_guatemalan_presidential_election.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top\">women and LGBTQ Guatemalans</a>. One of his running characters is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/19/jimmy-morales-used-to-do-black-face-comedy-hes-now-poised-to-be-guatemalas-president/\">black man played by Morales in blackface</a>.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, Morales needs to deliver on his anti-corruption promises. That'll be even harder than it seems: His party only holds a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/guatemalans-begin-voting-in-presidential-election-1445798537\">minority of seats in parliament</a>, meaning the new president will be facing a fairly hostile legislature. To make matters worse, Morales may not have many allies he can rely on.</p>\n<p>\"He's very smart, but he's had to assemble a team of people to help him get this far,\" Transparency International's Marroqu&#237;n told <a href=\"http://latinamericagoesglobal.org/2015/10/interview-chris-sabatini-talks-to-mandfredo-marroquin-of-guatemala/\">Latin America Goes Global</a>. He went on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He's included some military officers-not just any military officers, but military officers with ties to some of the worst abuses of the past [during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war]. In part, he didn't know all of the details of the people he was involving. He's never been in politics before so he just grabbed the people he could.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's the tricky thing about a system as corrupt as Guatemala's: In order to get things done, even the purest of outsiders may need to work with folks with pretty dirty hands. Whether Morales can do that without sinking to their level entirely remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>"},{"description":"Planned cuts to tax credits would leave some people on low incomes facing effective tax rates of 93 per cent, according to a new analysis.

The proposals ostensibly uphold the principle, but internet activists are concerned that they contain multiple loopholes, and do no such thing.</p>\n<p> Ahead of the vote, a spokesperson for digital rights group EDRi - who has been campaigning for amendments - told Business Insider that the vote is legally binding and will likely come into effect in November. EDRi says it will attempt to work with European data regulator BEREC to make sure that \"the vagueness of the text is resolved.\"</p>\n<p> Reacting to the vote, MEP Marietje Schaake said that it was a \"missed opportunity.\"</p>\n<p> In a statement, the Dutch politician said that \"too much attention was given to the interests of national telecom companies and too little to those of internet users and the economy of the future.

These are:</p>\n<p> The proposal allows ISPs to create fast lanes for companies that pay through the specialized services exception.</p>\n<p> This exemption is intended for \"specialized services\" - like medical data, say - but van Schewick argues that the exception is \"too broad,\" and that \"in many cases, it still allows ISPs to offer fast lanes by calling them a specialized service.\" The proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it, leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases.</p>\n<p> The proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it, leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases.<br></p>\n<p><br> If a service is zero-rated, it doesn't count towards a users' bandwidth cap or usage costs. This means companies could pay ISPs to be zero-rated - once again creating an unequal internet.</p>\n<p><br> The proposal allows ISPs to define classes and speed up or slow down traffic in those classes, even if there is no congestion.</p>\n<p><br> ISPs could still choose to discriminate against certain kinds of data (like peer-to-peer torrenting, for example). Van Schewick worries that because ISPs will not be able to identify what \"class\" encrypted data fits in, they will simply put them in the slowest lane - as has happened before. This will discourage the use of encryption, and make the internet less secure.</p>\n<p><br> The proposal allows ISPs to start managing congestion in the case of impending congestion. That means that they can slow down traffic anytime, not just during times of actual congestion.</p>\n<p> Van Schewick thinks this will be used as an excuse for discriminatory traffic management, \"using the justification that congestion was just about to materialize.\" </p>\n</div>"},{"description":"News Saudi Arabian prince, Abdul Mohsen bin Walid al-Saud was arrested by Lebanese officials on Monday, after attempting to smuggle two tons of amphetamines aboard his private jet.

Like methamphetamine, the drug is easily manufactured with store-bought ingredients, and sold throughout the middle-east.</p>\n<p>Popular with both ISIS fighters and Hezbollah militants on the ground in Syria, the drug has found use on all sides of the Syrian conflict in recent years.

One domestic worker - named as Monica - was raped by another servant in the household she worked for, and became pregnant. She pleaded with her \"madam\" to let her return to the Philippines, yet her request for help was turned down, with her madam relying on rights conferred under the kafala system: \"Why should I send you home? You haven't finished your contract.\" </p>\n<p>International outcry followed when Monica told her story to a popular radio show in the Philippines. She was subsequently allowed to go home - but in other cases, female migrant workers accused of zina remain trapped. </p>\n<p>Secret footage, from January 2014, also obtained by the BBC shows a woman on trial in the UAE shackled in chains, accused of having sex outside marriage with a fellow Filipino.</p>\n<strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/bangladeshs-epidemic-of-sexual-violence-reaches-boiling-point-following-alleged-mass-assault\">Bangladesh's Epidemic of Sexual Violence Reaches Boiling Point</a> <p>The extent of the abuse is unknown.

The agency has also recommended requiring a special permit to import lion trophies. Those findings could curtail the number of slain lions entering the US, while also driving up safari costs that are often more than $US100,000 (about $AUD138, 500).<br>That's leading to a rush of Americans taking their guns to Africa in pursuit of the king of the jungle. Last year, Americans imported a record 745 African lions as trophies, up 70 percent since 2011 and more than double the total in 2000, according to data from the Fish and Wildlife Service.<br>\"Guys fearing that I'll never get my opportunity to get a lion, they're getting it while the getting's good,\" said Aaron Neilson, an African safari broker based in Colorado whose exploits, including lion hunts, are featured on a Sportsman Channel television show.<br>\"The overall consensus among everybody selling lion hunts has been, 'Man, get it now.' \"<br>Trophy hunting has had a target on its back for years as animal rights groups seek to end a practice they see as pointless and brutal. The sport came under renewed scrutiny after a Minnesota dentist on a trophy hunt shot and killed Cecil, a beloved lion who lived in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, igniting a firestorm on social media. In response, airlines including United Continental Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. banned the shipping of certain African game trophies.<br>In July, Donald Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, was forced to answer for his sons after actress Mia Farrow tweeted a picture of them posing with a dead leopard. The next month, activists launched a boycott of Champaign, Illinois-based sandwich company Jimmy Johns LLC after photos of its founder, Jimmy John Liautaud, in front of a lifeless elephant circulated online.<br>Last year, the US banned the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Tanzania following reports that the species was in decline. Voters in Washington next month will decide on a ballot item backed by billionaire Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen that would criminalise the trafficking of animal parts from several hunted species, including leopards and rhinoceroses.<br>The trophy-hunting rush comes as wildlife experts try to stem a three-decade decline in the African lion population, which has been decimated by the loss of natural habitats, poaching and urbanisation. There are as few as 20,000 wild lions left on the continent, according to data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an environmental organisation based in Switzerland. That's down from more than 75,000 in 1980.<br>Proponents argue that curtailing legal hunting could imperil the lion even more because the fees generated go toward anti-poaching efforts and other conservation work, while also supporting local economies in Africa. That counterintuitive notion is acknowledged by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which has said trophy hunting isn't to blame for the lion's decline.<br>Animal-rights activists say ending trophy hunting is a sure way to halt the species' decline.<br>\"This is a blood sport,\" said Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare. \"It's 2015. We don't need to kill species to save them.\"<br>The lion remains the holy grail of trophies for sport hunters who say the animal's feline agility, elusiveness and fierce roar make for the hunt of a lifetime.<br>\"They are the meanest, wildest creatures in the world,\" said John J. Jackson III, chairman of Conservation Force, a group that advocates hunting as a means to conserve wildlife.<br> \"The greatest celebration in the empire of Rome was when Julius Caesar killed his 500th lion. It's always been the king of the beasts.\"<br></p>\n</div>\n  \n</div>"}],"feed":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews"}
